## 1. Prediction-of-House-Prices.ipynb

This notebook focuses on the prediction of house prices using regression models. The dataset used is the Boston Housing dataset, which contains information about various features of houses and their corresponding prices. The notebook explores different regression models and evaluates their performance in predicting house prices.

## 2. ASL_letters.ipynb

The ASL_letters.ipynb notebook deals with sign language recognition using the American Sign Language (ASL) alphabet. The dataset used in this project is derived from the MNIST sign language dataset. It consists of 27,455 grayscale images of size 28x28 pixels, representing the 26 letters of the English alphabet (excluding J and Z).

The notebook demonstrates the use of TensorFlow and utilizes data streaming generators to preprocess and load the dataset. The images are organized in folders corresponding to their respective classes, facilitating easy loading and visualization. The ASL_letters.ipynb notebook explores different machine learning approaches to classify the sign language images accurately.

## 3. Analysis-of-a-Sentiment-Classification-Model.ipynb

This notebook presents an analysis of a sentiment classification model using the IMDB database. The objective is to build a neural network model that can predict whether a movie review is positive or negative. The notebook explores various preprocessing techniques and evaluates the performance of different models in classifying sentiments.

## 4. Multiple-Classification-of-News.ipynb

The Multiple_Classification-of-News.ipynb notebook focuses on classifying news articles into their respective categories using a neural network.
